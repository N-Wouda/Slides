I've fixed the `chalkboard` and `menu` dependencies here, as it is quite hard
to find version of these plugins that work well with each other and `reveal.js`
v4+.

The `plugin.js` file and the `reveal-md.json` file in the root directory are 
based on [this](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md/issues/102) issue.
