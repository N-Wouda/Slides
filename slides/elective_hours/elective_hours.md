# The problem

- _Scheduling_: which electives to offer?
- _Personalising_: what electives do learners really need?
  - How can we know?

---

# The approach

- Multiple weeks
- Each week:
  - Optimise schedule given beliefs about learner needs
  - Update beliefs based on learner choices

Note:

Due to time limitations, I will not discuss the scheduling problem today.
It can be solved, using mostly straightforward math.
I would rather discuss learning/updating learner needs!
