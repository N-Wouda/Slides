# Conclusions

### Methodological

- Integrating multiple survey datasets is very worthwhile, and the more the 
  better
- High quality modern datasets are preferable


### Historical
- Major population growth from 300 BC until about AD 200, and decline thereafter
- Per capita consumption was also significantly higher, and not just among the elite
- Demand was first met locally, but increasingly from the wider Mediterranean
