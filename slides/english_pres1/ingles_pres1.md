## Motivation

- In NL, about 45% of total energy production is based on natural gas [3]
- Syngas has 'simple' chemistry:
    - **Electrolysis**: water + electricity $\longrightarrow$ hydrogen (+ oxygen)
    - **Methanation**: hydrogen + carbon dioxide + electricity $\longrightarrow$ syngas (+ water)
- When syngas is burned, carbon dioxide can be captured to make new syngas
- Syngas is **carbon-neutral** when renewable electricity is also used

----

## Motivation

- Methanation and carbon capture are very expensive
- But so were (offshore) wind and solar just a decade ago: [1]

    (Electrolysis cost has gone down by ~40% in the past five years [2])
</div>

## Motivation

- Syngas today is more expensive than natural gas
  - But how much more expensive?
  - What drives costs?
- What carbon tax would make syngas production cost-competitive?

---

## Solution approach

- If we can design a syngas production network at minimal cost, we:
  - have an estimate of the cost of syngas production;
  - know the relative costs of all parts of the network;
  - can determine a carbon tax that makes syngas production cost-competitive.
- This network design problem has many **policy implications**!

So, what I work on is this:
> How to construct a minimum-cost network for syngas production using captured carbon dioxide and renewable electricity?

---

## Conclusion

- Syngas is great in theory, but expensive in practice
- I want to find out what drives the cost of syngas production
- What is needed to make syngas cost-competitive?
