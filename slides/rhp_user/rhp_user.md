# This meeting

- The [technical slides](https://nielswouda.com/slides/rhp_tech/) discuss the
database schema. Should we recap?

- Example queries

Note:

The technical session was two days ago, so I think I can skip this. If not, 
start from the technical slides.

# Questions?

# That's all, folks!

- These slides are all online, so you can (re-)read them later.
 
- To facilitate re-use, there are a lot of (speaker) notes in the presentation.

- Anything unclear? Mail me at [nielswouda@gmail.com](mailto:nielswouda@gmail.com).
